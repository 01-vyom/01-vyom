## 🖖 Greetings, fellow geeks 
Hi, I'm Vyom, an automation enthusiast. My research interests lie in the field of Machine Learning, and Transformers. Beside's that I'm an avid reader and enjoy playing soccer.

<b>Current Status Quo</b>
- 🎓 &nbsp;I'm currently pursing Master of Science in Computer Science at [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) in the [CISE Department](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/) until April 2023. I completed my B. Tech. in Computer Engineering from [Dharmsinh Desai University](https://ddu.ac.in/) in May 2021.
- 💼 &nbsp;I'm currently a Research Assistant at [Data Science Research Lab](https://dsr.cise.ufl.edu/). Previously, I interned at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) on the Siri Text-to-Speech team as a Machine Learning Intern and at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) on the Alexa Smart Home Team as an Applied Scientist Intern. Before that, I worked at ISRO as a Research Intern working on the Oceanographical Satellite data interpretation using Machine Learning.
- 🔭 &nbsp;I’m currently working on transformers for different NLP tasks; particularly Prompting on Large Language Models, Automatic Speech Recognition for Low-resource languages/multi-lingual setting, Dialogue Systems, Speech Enhancement, Text-to-Speech Generation, and Natural Language Generation.
- 🌱 &nbsp;I'm currently learning applications of deep learning, writing research papers, and improving my coding skills.
- 💬 Ask me about anything, I am happy to help. I am very much open to new research ideas and collaborations.
