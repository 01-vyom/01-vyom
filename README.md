## üññ Greetings, fellow geeks 
Hi, I'm Vyom, an enthusiast for automation at scale. My research interests lie at the intersection of speech processing, machine learning, and transformers. Beside's that I'm an avid reader and enjoy playing soccer.

<b>Current Status Quo</b>
- üéì &nbsp;I completed my master of science in computer science at [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) from the [CISE Department](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/) in May 2023. I completed my bachelors of technology in computer engineering from [Dharmsinh Desai University](https://ddu.ac.in/) in May 2021.
- üíº &nbsp;I'm currently an applied scientist at [Chronograph](https://www.chronograph.pe/), and a research assistant at [Data Science Research Lab](https://dsr.cise.ufl.edu/). Previously, I interned at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) on the Siri Text-to-Speech team as a machine learning researcher and at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) on the Alexa Smart Home team as an applied scientist. Before that, I worked at ISRO as a Research Intern working on the oceanographical satellite data interpretation using machine learning.
- üî≠ &nbsp;I‚Äôm currently working on transformers for different NLP tasks; particularly prompting large language models, automatic speech recognition for low-resource languages/multi-lingual setting, dialogue systems, speech enhancement, text-to-speech generation, and natural language generation.
- üå± &nbsp;I'm currently learning applications of deep learning, writing research papers, and improving my coding skills.
- üí¨ Ask me about anything, I am happy to help. I am very much open to new research ideas and collaborations. 
- üòÑ &nbsp;Pronouns: he/him/his
