## üññ Greetings, fellow geeks 
Hi, I'm Vyom, an automation enthusiast. My research interests lie in the field of Speech Processing, Machine Learning, and Transformers. Beside's that I'm an avid reader and enjoy playing soccer.

<b>Current Status Quo</b>
- üéì &nbsp;I'm currently pursing Master of Science in Computer Science at [University of Florida](https://www.ufl.edu/) in the [CISE Department](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/) until April 2023. I completed my B. Tech. in Computer Engineering from [Dharmsinh Desai University](https://ddu.ac.in/) in May 2021.
- üíº &nbsp;I'm currently a Research Assistant at [Data Science Research Lab](https://dsr.cise.ufl.edu/). Previously, I interned at [Apple](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) on the Siri Text-to-Speech team as a Machine Learning Researcher and at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/) on the Alexa Smart Home Team as an Applied Scientist. Before that, I worked at ISRO as a Research Intern working on the Oceanographical Satellite data interpretation using Machine Learning.
- üî≠ &nbsp;I‚Äôm currently working on transformers for different NLP tasks; particularly Prompting on Large Language Models, Automatic Speech Recognition for Low-resource languages/multi-lingual setting, Dialogue Systems, Speech Enhancement, Text-to-Speech Generation, and Natural Language Generation.
- üå± &nbsp;I'm currently learning applications of deep learning, writing research papers, and improving my coding skills.
- üí¨ Ask me about anything, I am happy to help. I am very much open to new research ideas and collaborations. 
- üòÑ &nbsp;Pronouns: he/him/his
